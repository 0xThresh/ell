# Ell Todos

## Ell Studio

* Group LMPS by Run: At high-level, we would like to be able to visualize all of the various prompts that existed during a specific run of a python process. There are some issues here around when I'm doing process parallel vacations, or go unicorn style web apps that are running language model programs but some notion of this was the serialized form of the source code when I ran these invocations and they all belong to that same run category for what are the latest language model programs and visualizing the graph thereabouts.
* An index for fast querying of the file store. 
* Nice interface for viewing invocations themselvers i na readable way. 
* Visaulizing the dependency grapho language mdoel programs.
* Visualziing the "Horizontal flow of invocaitons"
* Cost analysis of different language model chains
* 'Automatic language model commit messages based on diffs' 
* Automatic RLHF and comparison data collection
* Metric functiosn and test tracking 
* A vscode plugin
* If in git repo and doing local developemnt (not deployment) automatic creation of a filesystem serialziaiton directory for current root. ellconfig.yaml 


## Serialization 
* Originators work
* Build an index.
